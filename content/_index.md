To answer the question, **Tagazok** which mean ```"Welcome, health and happiness on you!"``` is a dwarf word created by pen of chaos in their famous french audio series [Le Donjon de Naheulbeuk](http://www.penofchaos.com/warham/donjon.htm). As a passionate listener of audio series I couldn't stop myself of doing this little reference ;)

On this blog I will mostly post about my experience as a developer who has enough experience to not be a junior but always fell like one.

I'm gonna talk about projects I'm working on, ideas for my infrastructure, decision I've made for myself and my career, tools, languages, events. I'm also gonna create some tutorial for beginner. I'm planning to make some game series with the [Amethyst](https://amethyst.rs/) framework.

I'm mostly working on [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/fr) language with the framework [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/v0.3/) and some [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) configuration but I like to learn new technology.
